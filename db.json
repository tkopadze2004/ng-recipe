      "image": "https://i.ibb.co/99BcWLcN/sandwich.webp",
      "ingredients": [
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "1/2 teaspoon salt",
        "1/4 teaspoon pepper",
        "4 ciabatta rolls",
        "1/4 cup pesto, store-bought",
        "1 ball of mozzarella, sliced",
        "2  beefsteak tomatoes, sliced",
        "20 to 24 leaf basil leaves",
        "2 tablespoons balsamic glaze"
      ],
      "instructions": "Prep the chicken:\nCut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise, creating 4 thin filets. Sandwich a piece between two pieces of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Use a meat mallet or rolling pin to beat it to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Repeat with the remaining 3 filets.\n\nMarinate the chicken:\nIn a shallow dish, whisk together the olive oil, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Place the chicken in the dish and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge to marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 8 hours.\nGrill the chicken and toast the buns:\nPreheat your grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grates. \n\nRemove the chicken from the marinade and place it on the grill. Cook on one side for 3 minutes, then flip and cook on the other side for 3 minutes. Try not to move the chicken while it cooks except for flipping once. The chicken should be cooked through, golden with grill marks, and the internal temperature should be 165°F. Transfer the chicken to a plate and let it rest for 5 minutes.\n\nWhile the chicken is grilling, you can also toast the rolls by placing them cut-side down on the grill for 1 to 2 minutes.\nAssemble the sandwich:\nSpread a generous layer of pesto on the bottom half of each ciabatta roll (about a tablespoon per roll). Add a layer of mozzarella slices, then a layer of tomato slices. Place a piece of grilled chicken on each sandwich. Finish off the sandwich with 5 to 6 fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of balsamic glaze, if desired. Place the other half of the roll on top.\n\nThis sandwich is best if you eat it fresh off the grill. Store any leftover chicken and in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Store the tomatoes and mozzarella in a separate container.\n\nTo reheat the chicken, place it in the oven at 400°F for 10 minutes, then assemble your sandwich.\n\n"

Do not overwork the meat, as this will make the burgers tough—just fold everything together until well-mixed.\n\nForm patties:\nForm patties with the meat, using about 1/4 to 1/3 of a pound of meat per patty. Tip: Press a slight indentation in the center of each patty to help them maintain a nice disk shape while cooking—otherwise, they might become egg-shaped as the edges contract.\n\nGrill or fry the burgers:\nGrill or fry the burgers on medium heat for about 6-7 minutes per side (adjust for thickness and heat), or until the internal temperature reaches 140°F for medium rare or 160°F for well done. If you trust the source of your ground meat (e.g., Whole Foods), you can cook the burgers rare or medium rare. Otherwise, cook them well done. Avoid pressing on the burgers during cooking, and minimize flipping.\n\nLet the burgers rest for about 5 minutes before serving."
